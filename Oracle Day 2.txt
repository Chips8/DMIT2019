Table constraints IF you have to.
Realistically, they're both legal, but it's better to do Column then Table Constraints.
Table you have to tell WHAT column you are doing the constraint on.
**A column can see itself, if you have constraint with multiple COLUMNS it MUST be table constraint.

Make sure it's ORACLE Create Table, it is different from SQL Create Table.
Either it works or it doesn't.
Create through Citrix Reciever.
