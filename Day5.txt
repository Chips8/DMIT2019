35-50 input lines to test Lab 1; Instructor will be using 80-96 Lines to test Lab1.
Make sure to check right data types for lab.
SQL developer
Version 4 2017
there's version 18; skips 5 - 18, naming convention is based off of year.

2 char in select function and run in a function outside

You need 3 Mickey Mouseset  tables or you can't test
Build a good ERD for Lab 1, it will be used for 5 assessments.


Do we need 20 characters per number; NO
We only need 6.
This is a bug, Once in a while if you have 2 column heading, first character goes on 2nd line.
A6, characters too short; so do A8 and the headings work great
Column headings are all double quotes " "
If I make too short it will start word wrapping,
make it 25 wide, if you have 256 words, say no problem make it into more lines and you won't lose any data.

Instead of something 256 characters wide, we're at 96.
What's at last column, a bit too narrow
Should numbers be left justified or right justified.
How do you justify column heading
How to put space on left side of column

Column headings only change headings
Use LPAD to alter position of numbers in SELECT statement; NOT Headings

Keep things simple, so he can read the results faster. No need to show him every result.

Every 40 to 50 minutes, save and give version numbers, just incase.
Github not so good on binary files.
Just be careful using github to update binary files.
Github is good for text files.
Use some form of version control, back up data*.

What does the A20 means?
A justifies how many characters per line.
The | pushes it one line down.

What does Justify Right do?
Just to shift the heading to the right for  visual purposes, Defaults to the left.
What does the || mean?
Is an encatanation: used to link things together.
